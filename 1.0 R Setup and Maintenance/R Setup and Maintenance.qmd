## Fresh Setup

If you are getting your machine set up for using R for the first time, follow these steps below.

**1) Install R**

-   Download and install R from CRAN: [**https://cran.r-project.org/**](https://cran.r-project.org/)

-   You should be able to install in a user directory and not require admin privileges.

**2) Install R tools**

-   Install Rtools: [**https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/**](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

**2) Install RStudio (Posit)**

-   Download and install RStudio Desktop (Posit): [**https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

-   Launch RStudio and confirm it finds your R installation (Tools → Global Options → R version).

**3) Install Git**

-   Download Git for your OS: [**https://git-scm.com/**](https://git-scm.com/) and install.

**4) Create a GitHub account**

-   Go to [**https://github.com/**](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account.

-   Request to join the TTC-ENW GitHub organization: <https://github.com/TTC-ENW>

**5) Github Setup**

-   Use these instructions for setting up RStudio to use Git. <https://happygitwithr.com/>

## Keeping R Up To Date

The info bar above the console window indicates the R version you are using. When a new version of R is available, it must be done in the basic R interface (RGui) (i.e., not in RStudio).

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("installr")
library(installr)
updateR()
```

After R has been updated in the basic R interface, you will probably need to tell RStudio where to find the version you would like to use (usually the latest) under Tools \> Global Options.

## Keeping RStudio Up To Date

RStudio will let you know when its time.

## Package Updates

Its good to keep your packages up to date. There will be a time when a package you are using is not working because some of the dependencies have been updated and your main package has not.

## Good Practices

-   New respositories should start with a 2-letter code. Use underscores to separate words. All lower case.

-   Add a README.md and .gitignore.

-   Repositories should be private, except for material that is not sensitive, like this learning and reference repo.

-   Use short, descriptive commit messages.

-   Push often and pull before working to avoid conflicts.
