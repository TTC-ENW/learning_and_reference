## Keeping R Up To Date

The info bar above the console window indicates the R version you are using. When a new version of R is available, it must be done in the basic R interface (RGui) (i.e., not in RStudio).

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("installr")
library(installr)
updateR()
```

After R has been updated in the basic R interface, you will probably need to tell RStudio where to find the version you would like to use (usually the latest) under Tools \> Global Options.

## Keeping RStudio Up To Date

RStudio will let you know when its time.

## Package Updates

Its good to keep your packages up to date. There will be a time when a package you are using is not working because some of the dependencies have been updated and your main package has not.

## Github Setup

Use these instructions for setting up RStudio to use Git. <https://happygitwithr.com/>
